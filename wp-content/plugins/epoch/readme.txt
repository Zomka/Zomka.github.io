Epoch - 100% realtime chat and commenting in a tiny little package that is fully CDN and cache compatible.

== Description ==

Epoch is a new plugin from the creators of [Postmatic](http://gopostmatic.com). The goal: To provide a realtime commenting/chat experience using fully native comments while being compatible with page caching, cdns, mobile, other comment plugins, and seo best practices. A tall order? For sure. Try it out.

Epoch provides an amazing commenting experience to your users **while improving site performance at the same time**.

**Key Features**

- WordPress *native comments*
- Realtime with minimal server load
- Fully ajax commenting for both sending and receiving comments
- Integrates with any theme while still blending in with your brand
- Front end moderation with realtime updates. It's insanely fast.


= Epoch solves three big native commenting problems =

**User Experience**

Comment forms and display are often neglected by theme developers. We've been there ourselves. The functions and templates involved in WordPress commenting are complicated, frustrating, and no fun to work with. Every day we see fantastic themes with ridiculously poor commenting experiences. So that's the first thing Epoch fixes.

**Speed and context**

No more submitting comments and watching the page reload. All Epoch comments are submitted via ajax and post instantly in their proper place within the conversation.

And, as it should be, new comments from other users show up like magic automatically. It doesn't matter if they are posted from the web, or from email via [Postmatic](http://gopostmatic.com). The conversation is instantly updated.

**Cacheing, page load, and CDNs**

Epoch is hands down the fastest commenting system available for WordPress, all the while supporting page cacheing and CDNs. Epoch comments lazy load into a placeholder container only when needed. This means your post will load instantly, your comments will load instantly, and your server won't blink. Comments are magically injected into your page so your full SEO mojo stays in tact.


= Success through compatibility =
Epoch is built for compatibility. It uses fully native WordPress commenting, plays nicely with most all other commenting plugins, and employs WordPress coding standards. Use it with your favorite social login, voting, moderation, and other commenting plugins.

**Epoch is fully integrated with Postmatic**

When running Epoch along with [Postmatic](http://gopostmatic.com) the magic really happens. The comment stream is updated in realtime with comments being posted from web as well as email. Subscribing to new comments is quick and simple while users are intelligently invited to become site subscribers as well. All without ugly checkboxes and obtrusive forms.

**Want to jump into the ring and help with development?**

This is just 1.0. We're hoping the WordPress community will lend strength, ideas, and code to this project. That's why we've kept it open-source. You can find Epoch on Github and jump right in. We can't wait to see where commenting goes next.

= Combine Epoch with [Postmatic](http://gopostmatic.com) for the ultimate engagment package =

Postmatic is a free plugin which lets users subscribe to comments **but also reply right from their inbox by hitting reply**. Postmatic and Epoch integrate perfectly to let you take the conversation on the road and keep the conversation going months after you hit publish.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin through the WordPress Plugins Installer or upload `plugin-name.php` to the plugins directory of your content directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Epoch will then override the comment template that came with your theme. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Epoch override my native comments template? =

Only if you want it to. You can choose to style your comments using of our built in themes or use the comments template that is already in place on your site.

= Are comments displayed in ascending, or descending order? =

You choose. Epoch can go either way.

= Will Epoch kill my server with all of these ajax requests? =

Nope! Epoch is smarter than smart. No need to worry about that.

== Screenshots ==
1. Epoch integrates with your existing theme by matching the colors, typography, and width of your content area. Automatically.
2. The options are simple. Installation is as simple as activating the plugin.
3. Epoch is 100% mobile friendly and fully responsive. Nested comments 6 levels deep still look awesome.
4. Epoch is compatible with other 3rd party commenting plugins such as Postmatic (enable commenting by email), WordPress Social Login (for logging in via Twitter, Facebook, and more), WP-reCAPTCHA, Aksimet, and WordPress Zero Spam (Spam protection), and WYSIWYG Comment Form (for adding a toolbard to the comment area).



== Changelog ==

= 1.0.14 =

- This is the real deal. What 10.0.11/12 was meant to be! Nice fast comment posting even on your broken down dinohost server using your homebrewed ie6 port on that galaxy 3 you dumpstered in brooklyln. Because you can. Well, now we can too. So let's get along and be kind to each other. Mmmk? 
- There probably won't be a lot more Epoch development until we get 2.0 out the door. Which involves a huge bucket of awesome like REST and maybe Angular or something top secret and better. Be in touch if you want to help out.

= 1.0.13 =

This release was really just a rollback to 10.0.10 because everything after that broke wptavern. I wish I was allowed to put expletives in changelogs.

= 1.0.12 =

Sorry for two releases in one day. Jason's schedule cleared a bit and, well, we got ambitious. 

- A slight improvement over the previous release for making comments post licketly split.
- We cleaned things up a little bit more for improved 4.4 layouts and compatibility with [Postmatic Social Commenting](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic-social-commenting/).

= 1.0.11 =

- Ooooh so fast. Or at least it looks that way. Submitting comments on slowpoke servers (i'm not pointing fingers... you know who you are) is now quick quick quick. We are injecting the comment directly into the DOM for the user... which lets the server sit back and think about it as long as it wants.
- Tested and beaten up thoroughly. Works well on 4.4. 

= 1.0.10 =

- Ajax requests on some server environments are taking too long when submitting a comment. We've put in an animation to fade the comment form out while the user waits for the comment to post. 
- The yellow fade when a new comment arrives has returned!
- Fixed a bug that would display &amp when someone used an amperstand in their name.

= 1.0.9 =

- Added support for our new plugin: [Postmatic Social Commenting](http://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic-social-commenting). Lightweight, simple, and fast social authentication. Read about it [on our blog](http://gopostmatic.com/2015/11/weve-finally-fâ€¦ocial-networks/).
- We've improved validation alerts when filling out the comment form.

= 1.0.8 =

The first of a series of releases which will be focusing on speed and performance. 

- We've come up with a low-tech & high performance solution to polling the server for new comments. It's experimental depending on your host but you can read all about how to activate it [here](http://docs.gopostmatic.com/article/192-how-to-enable-even-lighter-weight-server-polling). Official support from varying hosts coming soon.
- Somewhere in the depths of earlier development Epoch stopped being smart about when to load and when to lay low. That's been fixed, improved upon, and had a serious IQ lift.
- There was a horrible war between Epoch and some antispam plugins on certain configurations. 'Twas ugly but now has been fixed. This resolves the *your comment was not accepted, please verify that everything is filled out correctly* problem.
- We made a fancy loading spinner that tricks your brain into not being bored when you are waiting for comments to load. Silly humans. We have a lot of work to do regarding loading performance on posts with 100+ comments. We have plans.
- There was an issue with the trackbacks/pings setting not saving/rendering correctly. Fixed.
- We've added some special styles for [Rating System](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rating-system/). Go rate some comments.

= 1.0.7.1 =

- A quick fix for a fatal error on activation that was present in 1.0.7. Plus Jason had another cool idea for rendering Crowd Control on mobile after sleeping on it. :)

= 1.0.7 =

- Refined the styles on pending comments. Less gray, more black. New clock icon.
- Improved iframe filters for 3rd party plugins to integrate in iframe mode.
- Updated French translation.
- Integration with Crowd Control for showing/hiding report link on hover (desktop only).
- Added security to moderation calls.
- Adding the groundwork for some major performance improvements. More coming soon.

= 1.0.6.1 =

- We caught a bug in which adding a comment as an admin would throw a funky error. Fixed.

= 1.0.6 =

- Sweet. A small release to roll out a huge feature: front-end moderation of comments. Brought to you by the brilliant @ronalfy. Be careful. It's powerfully fun.
- We fixed things up so that if you do not want to use avatars we're cool with that.
- Improved styling of post author comments.

= 1.0.5 =

A great group effort with seriously nice contributions from @ronalfy and @cklosowski. There is still more to be done! [Want to help out?](https://github.com/postmatic/epoch/labels/help%20wanted)

- Comments which are being held for moderation are visible to the post author/admin on the front end. Front-end moderation coming next!

- Cleaner styling of all form fields in all views. Everything in its right place.

- Removed the headline while in iframe mode (Join the Conversation) as there was no way to properly link it to the comment form.
- Added special styling for comments left by the post author.

- Added German translation by R. Koller. Thanks!
- Made it easier to download and install Postmatic right from within Epoch.
